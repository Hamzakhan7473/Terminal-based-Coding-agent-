# 🎬 VIDEO DEMO SCRIPT - Terminal-based AI Coding Agent

## Complete Walkthrough for Recording (5-7 minutes)

---

## 🎯 INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)

### What to Say:
> "Hi, I'm going to show you an AI-powered coding assistant that runs entirely in your terminal. It's like Cursor, but free and open source. It can generate production-quality code, execute it securely, and understands your entire codebase."

### What to Show:
- Terminal window ready
- GitHub repository page in browser (optional)

---

## 📋 PART 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW (1 minute)

### What to Say:
> "First, let me show you what this project includes. It has complete AI integration with GPT-4, secure code execution with E2B sandboxes, and full codebase awareness."

### Commands to Run:
```bash
cd "/Users/hamzakhan/Terminal-based Coding agent "
ls -la
```

### What to Say While Showing Files:
> "We have the main coding agent package, configuration files, and several demo scripts. The .env file contains our API keys but is safely ignored by git."

### Show Configuration:
```bash
cat env.example
```

### What to Say:
> "Here's the configuration template. It supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and E2B for sandbox execution. All API connections are working."

---

## 🚀 PART 2: STARTING THE AGENT (30 seconds)

### What to Say:
> "Let's start the enhanced agent with all features enabled."

### Command to Run:
```bash
python3 enhanced_agent.py
```

### What to Say While It Loads:
> "The agent is initializing. It's connecting to GPT-4, loading the E2B sandbox, and indexing our entire codebase. This gives it complete project awareness, just like Cursor."

### Wait for:
```
>> Initializing AI Coding Agent...
>> Indexing codebase... LOADED (cached)
>> All systems operational

AI CODING ASSISTANT
...
What can I help you code today?
> AI has indexed your entire codebase
```

---

## 🔍 PART 3: CODEBASE AWARENESS (1 minute)

### What to Say:
> "First, let me show you the codebase awareness feature. The AI has indexed every file in the project."

### Command to Type:
```
codebase
```

### What to Say While Showing:
> "As you can see, it indexed 28 files with over 5,000 lines of code. It found 133 symbols - that's functions and classes. It knows the entire project structure."

### Next Command:
```
find CodeGenerator
```

### What to Say:
> "I can search the codebase semantically. Here it found the CodeGenerator class in the core module, showing relevance scores and file information."

### Next Command:
```
browse
```

### What to Say:
> "The file browser shows the project structure with file type icons. You can see the coding_agent package with all its modules - core, execution, context, CLI, and utilities."

---

## 💻 PART 4: CODE GENERATION (2 minutes)

### What to Say:
> "Now let's see the real power - AI code generation. I'll ask it to create something complex."

### Command to Type:
```
Create a web scraper that extracts product titles and prices from an e-commerce website using BeautifulSoup and requests
```

### What to Say While AI Generates:
> "Watch this. The AI is analyzing the request, understanding it wants a web scraper, and generating production-quality code."

### Wait for AI Generated Code to Appear

### What to Say:
> "Look at this. It generated a complete, production-ready web scraper with proper error handling, documentation, and example usage. This isn't just hello world - this is real, working code. Notice the clear 'AI GENERATED CODE' label at the top."

### When Asked to Save:
```
y
```

### What to Say:
> "I'll save it. The system asks if I want to execute it. For now, I'll skip that."

### When Asked to Execute:
```
n
```

---

## 🔍 PART 5: ANOTHER EXAMPLE - REST API (1.5 minutes)

### What to Say:
> "Let me show you another example. I'll ask it to create a REST API."

### Command to Type:
```
Create a Flask REST API with user authentication using JWT, including register, login, and protected routes
```

### What to Say While Generating:
> "This is a much more complex request. It needs to understand Flask, JWT authentication, database models, and API endpoints."

### Wait for Code

### What to Say:
> "Incredible. It generated a complete REST API with user registration, login endpoints, JWT token generation, password hashing, protected routes, and proper error handling. This is production-ready code that you could actually deploy."

### When Asked to Save:
```
y
```

### What to Say:
> "I'll save this to api.py."

---

## ⚡ PART 6: CODE EXECUTION (1 minute)

### What to Say:
> "Now let's test the code execution feature. I'll create a simpler algorithm to execute."

### Command to Type:
```
Create a function that implements binary search and test it with sample data
```

### Wait for Code

### What to Say:
> "Perfect. It created a binary search implementation with test data."

### When Asked to Save:
```
y
```

### When Asked to Execute:
```
y
```

### What to Say While Executing:
> "Now it's executing the code in a secure E2B sandbox. This is completely isolated from my system."

### When Results Appear:

### What to Say:
> "Excellent! The code executed successfully. You can see the output showing the binary search working correctly. Execution time was under a second. This proves the code isn't just syntactically correct - it actually runs and produces the right results."

---

## 📁 PART 7: FILE OPERATIONS (45 seconds)

### What to Say:
> "Let me show you the file viewing capabilities."

### Command to Type:
```
edit coding_agent/core/code_generator.py
```

### What to Say:
> "Here's our code generator file with full syntax highlighting, line numbers, and file statistics. Below you can see the file context - what symbols it contains, what it imports, and related files."

### Command to Type:
```
find execute
```

### What to Say:
> "I can instantly search for any code. Here it found all files related to execution - the sandbox executor, intent parser, and CLI interface."

---

## 🎯 PART 8: KEY FEATURES SUMMARY (45 seconds)

### Command to Type:
```
help
```

### What to Say:
> "Let me show you all available features."

### What to Say While Showing Help:
> "The agent can:
> - Generate code from natural language - and I mean REAL code, not hello world
> - Execute code securely in sandboxes
> - Debug and fix errors
> - Explain code concepts
> - Navigate and search your entire codebase
> - Work with multiple programming languages
> - Provide context-aware suggestions based on your existing code
> 
> It has commands for browsing files, searching code, showing project structure, and more. All of this runs locally with your own API keys."

---

## 💡 PART 9: COMPARISON WITH CURSOR (30 seconds)

### What to Say:
> "So how does this compare to Cursor?
> 
> Like Cursor, it:
> - Knows your entire codebase
> - Generates intelligent, context-aware code
> - Has a beautiful interface with syntax highlighting
> - Provides semantic search and file navigation
> 
> But it also has advantages:
> - It can execute code securely - Cursor can't do that
> - It's completely free and open source
> - You control your own API keys and data
> - It works in any terminal, anywhere
> 
> The trade-off is it doesn't have inline editing in VS Code, but for a terminal-based solution, this is incredibly powerful."

---

## 🎬 CLOSING (30 seconds)

### Command to Type:
```
status
```

### What to Say:
> "You can see the session status - how many messages, files indexed, current file. Everything is tracked."

### Command to Type:
```
exit
```

### What to Say:
> "This is a complete AI coding assistant that you can use for real development work. The code is on GitHub, it's open source, and you can set it up in minutes.
